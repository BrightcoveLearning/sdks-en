<p>For Video Cloud customers, in most cases, when you use the Brightcove Player SDK for iOS, your app is registered automatically. For Brightcove Player customers, you need to send your account id from your app. See the details below.</p>

<p>If you use the Brightcove player and the <code>Catalog</code> class included in the SDK to retrieve and play videos, your app will be registered with Brightcove automatically. Also, analytics data will be collected and will appear in your Video Cloud Analytics.</p>

<p>If you override the <code>BCOVVideo</code> class or do not use the Brightcove player and catalog, you need to send your Video Cloud Publisher ID to Video Cloud Analytics. You can do this by setting the analytics <code>account</code> value. This also allows you to view data for this app in Video Cloud Analytics.</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-swift">static NSString * const kPublisherID = @"&lt;insert valid accountId&gt;"; // for analytics

    _playbackController.analytics.account = kPublisherID;</code></pre>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">For details about sending data to Video Cloud Analytics, see the <a href="/node/18214">Using Brightcove Analytics</a> guide.</aside>
