<p>The Brightcove Native Player SDK for iOS provides integration points for advertising, analytics and content protection. It also provides player controls similar to the Brightcove web player and allows you to play back live stream events.</p>

<p>The entry point to the Brightcove Player SDK for iOS is the <code translate="No">BCOVPlayerSDKManager</code> singleton object. It provides the following functionality:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Serves as an object factory for components, including the <code translate="No">BCOVPlaybackController</code></li>
	<li>Hooks up analytics</li>
	<li>Keeps track of which plugins are being used</li>
</ul>

<p>To create a player, start with the <code translate="No">BCOVPlayerSDKManager</code>.</p>

<p>For installation notes and a detailed architecture overview, see the <a href="https://github.com/brightcove/brightcove-player-sdk-ios">Brightcove Player SDK for iOS GitHub README</a> notes.</p>
