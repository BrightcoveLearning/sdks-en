<p>When you retrieve videos from the Brightcove catalog, the SDK has to decide which source to play. This is implemented in the <a href="/android/reference/javadoc/com/brightcove/player/controller/DefaultSourceSelectionController.html">DefaultSourceSelectionController</a> and <a href="/android/reference/javadoc/com/brightcove/player/controller/ExoPlayerSourceSelectionController.html">ExoPlayerSourceSelectionController</a> components.</p>

<h2 id="Default_selection_process">Default selection process</h2>

<p>The Brightcove Player SDK for Android uses a default source selection process. To simplify, we will focus on the SDK’s support for the Brightcove Playback API and Google’s ExoPlayer.</p>

<p>The default selection process is defined as follows:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>
	<p>With the Brightcove Native SDK for Android 6.4+, HTTPS delivery for all source types is selected if available.</p>

	<p>Both the <a href="/android/reference/javadoc/com/brightcove/player/controller/DefaultSourceSelectionController.html">DefaultSourceSelectionController</a> and <a href="/android/reference/javadoc/com/brightcove/player/controller/ExoPlayerSourceSelectionController.html">ExoPlayerSourceSelectionController</a> attempt to select the HTTPS version of the <code translate="No">deliveryType</code> selected. If no HTTPS source exists, the selection controller will select the first available.</p>

	<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">If your video has both HTTP and HTTPS sources for WebVTT captions/subtitles, then the Native SDK for Android may not return the HTTPS version. Brightcove is aware of this situation and will have a fix in a future release.</aside>
	</li>
	<li>The <a href="/android/reference/javadoc/com/brightcove/player/view/BrightcoveExoPlayerVideoView.html">BrightcoveExoPlayerVideoView</a> looks for the first source that has a <code translate="No">deliveryType</code> of <strong>MPEG-DASH</strong>, and a profile that is neither <strong>urn:hbbtv</strong> nor <strong>urn:dvb</strong>. The SDK does not support playback with either of these DASH profiles, and so they will be filtered out of the sources.</li>
	<li>If the above is not found, source selection falls back to the first source with a <code translate="No">deliveryType</code> of <strong>HLS</strong>.</li>
	<li>If no such source is found, it falls back to the source with a <code translate="No">deliveryType</code> of <strong>MP4</strong> and a bitrate closest to 256 kBps.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once a source is found, the implementation continues as follows:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>If found, the selected source will be emitted with a response to the <strong>SELECT_SOURCE</strong> event.</li>
	<li>By default, the <a href="/android/reference/javadoc/com/brightcove/player/controller/VideoPlaybackController.html">VideoPlaybackController</a> handles the <strong>SELECT_SOURCE</strong> response, by emitting a <strong>SET_SOURCE</strong> event.</li>
	<li>The <a href="/android/reference/javadoc/com/brightcove/player/display/VideoDisplayComponent.html">VideoDisplayComponent</a> or a subclass handles the <strong>SET_SOURCE</strong> event by loading the URL into the underlying player (ExoPlayer or MediaPlayer).</li>
	<li>When playback begins, the underlying player is responsible for adapting the bitrate with HLS and DASH content. With HLS, the underlying player starts with the first bitrate listed in the master manifest.</li>
</ol>

<p>When using the default transcode settings, the first HLS source should be the master m3u8 playlist that points to all of your individual sources (renditions).</p>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="Setting_HLS_sources">Setting HLS sources</h2>

<p>It is possible to customize source selection at the app level, to filter out any undesired delivery types before the SDK’s default source selection policy is invoked. To do this, you will modify the source collections that are set into the Video object from the Playback API's JSON response.</p>

<p>This example uses only HLS sources:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-java" translate="No">catalog.findVideoByReferenceID(videoReferenceId, new com.brightcove.player.edge.VideoListener() {
	@Override
	public void onVideo(Video video) {
      VideoUtil.filterSourcesOnDeliveryType(video, DeliveryType.HLS);
      brightcoveVideoView.add(video);
      brightcoveVideoView.start();
	}
});</code></pre>

<!-- <p>And the source filter method looks like this:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers">
  <code class="language-java" translate="No">public static void sourceSelectionFilter(@NonNull DeliveryType deliveryTypeFilter, @NonNull Video video) {
   if (video.getSourceCollections().containsKey(deliveryTypeFilter)) {
     // Only remove the other delivery types if the desired type is in our Source collections
     for (DeliveryType deliveryType : DeliveryType.values()) {
       if (!deliveryType.equals(deliveryTypeFilter)) {
              video.getSourceCollections().remove(deliveryType);
       }
     }
   }
  }</code></pre> -->
