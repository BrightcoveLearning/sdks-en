    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">It is important to note that the 6.17.2 build of the Brightcove Native SDK for Android includes a PRE-RELEASE version of the GSC feature. This release is intended for verification purposes, and not to be used in a production application.</aside>

      Generic Stream Concurrency lets you define the number of video streams that a specific user can watch concurrently. Limiting stream concurrency helps you prevent content being stolen or illegally watched through the theft or inappropriate sharing of credentials.
    </p>
    <p>This feature is part of Playback Restrictions, and it’s an alternative to <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/playback-restrictions/guides/stream-concurrency.html">stream concurrency with DRM</a>, which is an alternative solution. </p>

    <p>For details, see the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/playback-restrictions/guides/generic-stream-concurrency.html">Generic Stream Concurrency</a> document.</p>

      To test Generic Stream Concurrency with your app, follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>
        <p>
          In your <strong translate="no">build.gradle</strong> file (or wherever you set your repositories block), add the following:
        </p>
        <pre>
<code class="language-java" translate="No">maven {
  url 'http://repo.brightcove.com/snapshots'
 }</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In your <strong translate="no">gradle.properties</strong> (or wherever you set your dependency version for the Brightcove Native SDK for Android), set the version value to <code translate="no">6.17.2-SNAPSHOT</code>. This will allow the pre-release snapshot build to be downloaded into Android Studio.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In your player Activity’s <strong translate="no">onCreate</strong> method, add this line:
        </p>
        <pre>
<code class="language-java" translate="No">brightcoveVideoView.setStreamConcurrencyEnabled(true);</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Optional</strong>: If you want to use runtime restrictions, you need to create a JWT token and pass it with the catalog request.
        </p>
        <p>
          To create your JWT token, follow the steps in the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/playback-restrictions/getting-started/overview-playback-restrictions.html#Runtime_restrictions">Runtime restrictions</a> section of the Overview: Brightcove Playback Restrictions document.
        </p>
        <p>
          To pass your token with the catalog request, see the <a href="#Using_License_Keys_Protection_Android">Using License Keys Protection: Android</a> section.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
