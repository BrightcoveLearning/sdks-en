  <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>

  <p>The Brightcove Native SDK for Android ("Android SDK") is available in a new major version bringing important changes in how it is built. This version includes new functionality to support the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Low Latency for HLS live streaming</li>

<h2 id="SDK_changes">SDK changes</h2>

<p>With this release of the Brightcove Native SDK for Android, the <code translate="No">MediaPlayer</code> class is no longer supported for content playback.</p>

<h3>Android 12 Compatibility</h3>

<p>The Native SDK for Android now offers Android OS 12 compatibility, and all of the features in Android 12 should work as expected. Brightcove recommends that you review the changes in Android 12 and modify your application code as needed.</p>
<p>For details, see the <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/summary">Android 12 features and changes list</a> reference.</p>

<h2 id="Apache_HTTP_client_deprecation">Apache HTTP client deprecation</h2>

<p>With Android Pie, Apache HTTP client support has been removed. This affects apps that target Android Pie or higher. It might also affect apps that target older versions of Android when using a non-standard <code translate="No">ClassLoader</code>. At runtime, if the <code translate="No">ClassLoader</code> attempts to load an Apache HTTP client class on Android Pie, it will throw a <code translate="No">NoClassDefFoundError</code>. For more information, see Google’s : <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/android-9.0-changes-all#apache-nonp">Apache HTTP client deprecation</a> document.</p>

<p>If your app is using the Brightcove FreeWheel plugin, you will experience this problem and get an exception as shown here:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-java" translate="No">java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: tv.freewheel.utils.URLLoader
Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Failed resolution of: Lorg/apache/http/impl/client/BasicCookieStore;</code></pre>

<p>In order to fix this problem, include the following line to your app’s manifest file:</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-java" translate="No">&lt;uses-library android:name="org.apache.http.legacy" android:required="false"/&gt;</code></pre>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="Deprecated_constants">Deprecated constants</h2>

<p>There are several constants that were deprecated in the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/ConnectivityManager">ConnectivityManager</a> class. Some of these constants are currently used by the Brightcove SDK, specifically by the Offline Playback and the Offline Analytics features. Here is the list:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code translate="No">android.net.ConnectivityManager.TYPE_BLUETOOTH</code></li>
	<li><code translate="No">android.net.ConnectivityManager.TYPE_ETHERNET</code></li>
	<li><code translate="No">android.net.ConnectivityManager.TYPE_MOBILE</code></li>
	<li><code translate="No">android.net.ConnectivityManager.TYPE_VPN</code></li>
	<li><code translate="No">android.net.ConnectivityManager.TYPE_WIFI</code></li>
	<li><code translate="No">android.net.ConnectivityManager.TYPE_WIMAX</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This doesn't affect any functionality on the mentioned features, but be aware that these constants might be removed in a future Android OS version. This also applies to the Brightcove Native SDK.</p>

<h2 id="Testing_limitations">Testing limitations</h2>

<p>Due to resource constraints, we have been unable to test the Brightcove SDK targeting Android Pie on a device that has a "cut-out" in its display. We are working on acquiring such a device to test with as soon as possible.</p>
