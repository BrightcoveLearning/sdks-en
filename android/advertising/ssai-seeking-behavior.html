<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>With the release of the Native SDK for Android version 6.18.0, there are some important changes to the SSAI Plugin that improve playback and seeking behavior, particularly in paused players.</p>
<p>Previously, when a user would seek forward and crossed an ad, the ad controls replaced the video controls immediately. This did not allow the user to keep seeking. The player would also keep the video content instead of replacing it with the ad content.</p>
<p>Now, users can seek forward and backward without the ads being played until the video is playing and the user has crossed an ad with the last seek.</p>

  <summary><h3 id="Use_case">Use case</h3></summary> 
    <p>Consider the following use case:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>The user loads a video with one or more mid-roll ads into the player and starts video playback.</li>
      <li>Before a mid-roll ad, the user pauses playback.</li>
      <li>While the player is paused, the user seeks across the mid-roll ad marker.</li>
      <li>While the player is still paused, the user seeks back across the mid-roll ad marker, back into the content just watched.</li>
      <li>After the seek, the player controls are available to the user. When the user presses <strong>Play</strong>, the content plays as expected.</li>
      <li>When playback reaches the midroll ad marker, the ad will play, with the ad controls displayed.</li>
      <li>After the midroll ad completes, the player completes the seek action to the seek target, where the content resumes playback, with the player controls.</li>
    </ol>

<h2 id="Plugin_Behavioral_Changes">Plugin Behavioral Changes</h2>
<p>The following classes have new behavior:</p>

<h3><code translate="No">SSAIComponent</code> class</h3>
<p>This class now passes the <code translate="No">BaseVideoView</code> object to the <code translate="No">TimelineManager</code> class when a reference to this is created.</p>
<p>It removed passing the references for the video playback controller and the ticker to the <code translate="No">SeekManager</code> when this is created and, instead it passes the event emitter. It also sets the seek listener from the timeline manager object to this new <code translate="No">SeekManager</code> reference.</p>
<p>It also removed the <code translate="No">SeekManager</code> object from being passed as an observer to the <code translate="No">Ticker</code> class.</p>

<h3><code translate="No">LastAdSeekStrategy</code> class</h3>
<p>This class is now public.</p>

<h3><code translate="No">NoAdSeekStrategy</code> class</h3>
<p>This class is now public.</p>

<h3><code translate="No">SeekManager</code> class</h3>
<p>This class no longer triggers the playback of ads. That functionality was moved to the <code translate="No">TimelineManager</code> where it makes more sense.</p>
<p>This class previously listened for <code translate="No">SEEK_TO</code> events and notified all the listeners subscribed to this class. With that action, it passed the new absolute time position and also emitted a new <code translate="No">SEEK_TO</code> event including the absolute position and the relative position. Now, <code translate="No">SeekManager</code> no longer emits a new seek event but still notifies all the listeners about the first seek event.</p>
<p>This class no longer implements the <code translate="No">TickerObserver</code> and <code translate="No">SeekTask.Seekable</code> classes and does not handle the events that those classes generate.</p>
<p>This class no longer handles <code translate="No">Skip Ad</code> events.</p>
<p>The constructor signature has changed from</p>
<pre><code class="language-java" translate="No">public SeekManager(VideoPlaybackController, Timeline, Ticker)
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code class="language-java" translate="No">public SeekManager(EventEmitter, Timeline)
</code></pre>

<h3><code translate="No">TimelineManager</code> class</h3>
<p>This class now handles the playback and skip action of ads. It is subscribed to the <code translate="No">SeekManager</code> class to listen for seek events. Once a seek event is detected, this class checks if an ad was crossed. If so, it plays the ad. If not, it repositions the playhead in the video content and updates the absolute and relative positions.</p>
<p>The ads are played once the video is playing. If the video is paused, it will not play any ad crossed by seek events. This provides the availability to support many seek events. If the video is playing and an ad is crossed, the ad is played immediately.</p>
<p>When an ad is crossed while the video is paused, the <code translate="No">TimelineManager</code> will resume the playhead position at the position before the ad was played.</p>
<p>The <code translate="No">TimelineManager</code> resumes playback in the previous position when a skip ad event is detected.</p>
<p>The TimelineManager class now extends <code translate="No">AbstractComponent</code>.</p>
<p>In order to create a <code translate="No">TimelineManager</code> object, you need to pass a <code translate="No">BaseVideoView</code> instance along with a <code translate="No">Timeline</code> instance.</p>

  <h2 id="API_Changes">API Changes</h2>
  <p>The following classes have API changes:</p>
  
  <h3><code translate="No">SeekTask</code> class</h3>
  <p>This class was deleted because its main functionality was integrated into the <code translate="No">TimelineManager</code> class where it makes more sense. </p>
  
  <h3><code translate="No">SeekManager</code> class</h3>
  <p>The constructor <code translate="No">SeekManager(VideoPlaybackController videoPlaybackController, Timeline timeline, Ticker ticker)</code> was deleted since it no longer needs the <code translate="No">VideoPlaybackController</code> and the <code translate="No">Ticker</code>. Instead, it now receives the <code translate="No">EventEmitter</code> and the <code translate="No">Timeline</code> as follows:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-java" translate="No">SeekManager(EventEmitter eventEmitter, Timeline timeline)
</code></pre>
  
  <h3><code translate="No">TimelineManager</code> class</h3>
  <p>The constructor <code translate="No">TimelineManager(@NonNull Timeline mTimeline)</code> was changed to the following:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-java" translate="No">TimelineManager(@NonNull BaseVideoView mBaseVideoView, @NonNull Timeline mTimeline)
  </code></pre>
