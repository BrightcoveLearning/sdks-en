<p>Support is defined in terms of the <strong>[major version].[minor version]</strong> of an OS (for example: Android 10.0). Customers can still use the Brightcove SDK for Android on unsupported versions, however we provide no guarantee of functionality.</p>

<h3>Google Play Store</h3>

<p>Google’s Play Store provides usage data for Android versions which have logged into the Play Store for a highlighted week. As of May 7th 2019, data shows that Android 5.0 and 5.1 account for 3.0% and 11.5% of total Android use respectively.</p>

<p>Current Play Store data can be found in the <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/">Android Distribution dashboard</a>.</p>

<!-- <h3>Brightcove Native Player SDK for Android</h3>

<p>In addition to examining the Play Store data, we can also review traffic that the Brightcove SDK is seeing across the different Android versions. This gives us an idea of who is actually watching video on their devices.</p>

<p>Our data is consistent with the graph from Google’s Play Store. We see in our chart above that Android 4.1 accounts for ~1% of total traffic, Android 4.2 ~2% and Android 4.3 is ~0%.</p> --></section>
