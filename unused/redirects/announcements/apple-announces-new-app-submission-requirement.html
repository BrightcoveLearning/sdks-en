<h2 id="Requirements_for_App_Store">Requirements for App Store</h2>

<p>To take advantage of the new features provided by the iOS SDK, Apple will require that all new apps submitted to the App Store must be built with the iOS 12.1 SDK or later. This requirement takes effect starting <strong>March 2019</strong>.</p>

<p>This means that to submit any new apps, you will have to use Xcode 10.1, which provides the tools to build apps for the latest SDKs, including iOS 12, tvOS 12 and Swift 4.2.</p>

<p>For details, see the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/submit/">Submitting iOS apps to the App Store</a> documentation.</p>

<p>Following Appleâ€™s lead, the Brightcove Native SDK for iOS/tvOS v6.3.10+ supports building with Xcode 10.1. If you have not already done so, please migrate to Xcode 10.1 as soon as possible.</p>
