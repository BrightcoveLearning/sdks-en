<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Brightcove Player SDK for Android solves most of the issues around HLS video playback on Android devices. For details about this solution, see the <a href="/android/playback/hls-playback-native-sdk-android.html">HLS Playback with the Player SDK for Android</a> document.</p>

<p>If you need to use Android's <code>MediaPlayer</code> for HLS playback, you may run into some limitations. See the section below for details about these limitations.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">If you are using <a href="/android/playback/hls-playback-native-sdk-android.html">HLS Playback with the Player SDK for Android</a>, the limitations in this section do not apply.</aside>

<p>You will only experience the issues in this section if you choose to use Android's <code>MediaPlayer</code> for HLS playback without Brightcove's solution. Here are the limitations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Android 4.x
	<ul>
		<li>HLS streams only seek to the beginning of segments due to an OS bug.
		<p>As a result, midroll ads are only supported with non-HLS streams, or with the Brightcove Player SDK (Android 4.1 or newer).</p>
		</li>
		<li>HLS streams do not consistently report the correct video duration due to an OS bug.
		<p>The Brightcove Player SDK (Android 4.1 or newer) does not have this limitation.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>The timer, counter, Learn More button overlay and some AdEvent events are missing with Google IMA midrolls due to a reported bug in the Google IMA SDK.</p>
		</li>
		<li>We have seen issues with Widevine content on some Samsung devices. The Widevine teams advise upgrading to the latest Android version.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Android 4.4.2
	<ul>
		<li>Playback will start, pause after a few seconds and then play from the start again.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>How can I get HLS to work on Android?</strong></p>

<p>To be able to provide adaptive streaming on Android, Brightcove's Player SDK provides HLS playback functionality for Android 4.1 and newer.</p>
<!--
            <p><strong>Are there any other options for adaptive streaming?</strong></p>
            <p>Widevine playback on Android provides its own proprietary adaptive streaming technology but is coupled with Widevine encryption and DRM.</p>
-->

<p><strong>What about HLSe?</strong></p>

<p>HLSe has the same limitations and recommendations as above.</p>
