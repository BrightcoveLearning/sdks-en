  <h2 id="platforms">Supported Platforms</h2> 
  <p>The Brightcove Web & Smart TV SDK is designed to support many web browsers and Smart TV platforms. This ensures developers can create applications that provide a consistent viewing experience across various devices and platforms. Below are the specific platforms supported by the SDK.</p>
  <br>
<h3>Supported Smart TV Platforms</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Samsung Tizen 6.0+</strong> (Chromium 76).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>LG webOS 6.x+</strong> (Chromium 79).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>Brightcove defines “supported platforms” as devices on which releases are fully tested and performance is guaranteed. Brightcove Technical Support is offered, and bug reports and feature enhancements are accepted.</p>

<h3>Supported Web Browsers</h3>
<p>The SDK is compatible with all major web browsers supported by the <a target="_blank" href="https://player.support.brightcove.com/references/brightcove-player-system-requirements.html">Brightcove Player</a>. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: Latest version.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong>: Latest version.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Apple Safari</strong>: Latest version on macOS and iOS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Microsoft Edge</strong>: Latest version.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Minimum Requirements for Unsupported Environments</h3>
<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">The Brightcove Support team cannot provide technical support for untested environments. </aside>
<p><strong>Brightcove expects the SDK to work on any Chromium platform that supports ES2015 onwards.</strong>

  However, Brightcove recognizes that Chromium implementations can vary subtly across devices, and some methods or APIs might be missing, requiring additional polyfills. Because of these potential differences, we cannot guarantee compatibility with a Chromium version on platforms we have not explicitly tested.
  </p>
  <p>Additionally, the following items should be considered minimum requirements for any successful implementation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Chromium version 85 and newer</strong></p></li>
  <li><p><strong>HTTPS with TLS 1.2</strong>.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Standards-compliant HTML5 video</strong></p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Media Source Extensions</strong></p></li>
  <li><p><strong>DRM</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Encrypted Media Source Extensions</p></li>
    <li><p>Widevine/PlayReady</p></li>
    <li><p>HDCP supports</p></li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Playback Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p>AVC/H.264 codec support for all video</p></li>
  <li><p>HEVC/H.265 recommended for 4K/UHD content</p></li>
  <li><p>AAC audio</p></li>
  <li><p>AC-3 and/or E-AC3/EC3 for multichannel audio (dependent on video and account configuration)</p></li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3 id="support">Support Policy</h3> 
<p>Brightcove's SDK support policy covers the last three model years for each smart TV platform. This means that if a new model year is introduced, support will extend to the three most recent model years.

  </p>
  <p>  For example, if the last OS version was released in 2023 and was not released in 2021, we support model years 2023, 2022, and 2020.
