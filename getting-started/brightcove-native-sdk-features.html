<p>As data consumers ourselves, we recognize that analytics are a powerful tool for understanding trends in your content. The Brightcove SDKs allow you to easily gather data whether you're a Video Cloud customer using Brightcove Analytics, a Brightcove Player customer using the analytics API's with your own backend, or some combination with a third-party integration such as Omniture.</p>

<h2 id="Digital_Rights_Management_DRM">Digital Rights Management (DRM) <img alt="" height="20px" width="20px" src="/assets/images/getting-started/bcls-icon-security.png" /></h2>
<p>We recognize that the security provided to video content using standards such as HLSe may not be enough to meet your strict protection requirements. DRM is a robust content protection program that enables you to enforce polices and rules for usage of your content.</p>

<p>The Brightcove SDKs enable you to integrate powerful DRM solutions and ensure the protection of your content without sacrificing the video experience your audience expects.</p>

<p>As a Brightcove Video Cloud customer, you have access to your Brightcove content (videos, image assets and playlists) through the Playback API, CMS API or the Brightcove catalog. The catalog is a library of helper methods you can use to access your Video Cloud library.</p>

<p>The tools for accessing your content through the Playback/CMS APIs and the catalog are built into the foundation of the Brightcove Mobile SDKs.</p>
