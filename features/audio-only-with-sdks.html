    <p>
      Audio-only streams allow you to tap into the sizable audio entertainment ecosystem, including podcasts and radio. With Brightcove, you can ingest and live stream audio-specific content without a video component. Brightcove's player technology has been optimized for audio to mobile, web, and connected home devices. You will even get relevant analytics for audio-only playback.

    <p>Here is an example of a poster image displayed for audio-only content.</p>
