    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      A bumper is typically a very short video (10 secs or less) automatically inserted before any pre-roll ads and your content. A bumper is not used for monetization but instead relays information such as your company logo or branding. 
    </p>
    <p>Here is an example of a bumper video playing before the main content.</p>

    <h2 id="Requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>The following requirements are needed for this feature:</p>

    <h3>Brightcove SDK version</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Native SDK for Android (coming soon)</li>
      <li>Native SDK for iOS 6.11.0 and newer</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2 id="Functionality">Functionality</h2>
    <p>
      Here are some details about Bumper videos: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bumpers are compatible with both Client-Side Advertising (CSAI) and Server-Side Advertising (SSAI)</li>
      <li>Bumpers play before any pre-roll ads and your content</li>
      <li>The player is configurable during bumper video playback:
        <ul>
          <li>Show/hide the player controls</li>
          <li>Prevent seeking during playback</li>
          <li>Change the seekbar color to indicate a bumper</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Analytics data will be tracked the same as for any content video</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Configuration">Configuration</h2>
    <p>A bumper video can be set for the player or for an individual video.</p>
    
    <h3>Player-level bumper</h3>
    <p>
      By default, bumper videos are a player-level feature. This means that all videos in a player will have the same bumper. 
    </p>
    <p>A bumper consists of a single Video Cloud video, referenced by either:
      <ul>
        <li>Video ID</li>
        <li>Reference ID</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Video-level bumper</h3>
    <p>To assign a bumper to a video, you can define a custom field in Video Cloud Studio. The custom field must have the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Custom field name of <code translate="no">bumper_id</code></li>
      <li>Custom field value must be a valid video ID</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Bumper IDs passed using the  <code translate="no">bumper_id</code> custom field take precedence over any ID specified in the player.</aside>
