<p>When you are ready to introduce custom controls in your app, look to the <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveOS/android-player-samples/tree/master/brightcove-player-controls/StyledControlsSampleApp">Styled Controlled Sample App</a> for guidance. In this sample, you can see how you can add a settings icon to control captions display.</p>

<p>Once you turn captions on, you will see them appear near the bottom of the video. This assumes that you have associated a captions file with your video.</p>
